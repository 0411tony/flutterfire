As mentioned, a "Screen" is a fully function, pre-styled and customizable widget which offers a complete authentication
expereince (such as Sign In, Register, Profile Screen). Screens are designed to be dropped into your application as a full
screen experience.

## Adding a screen

By design, a Screen does not depend on any implementation detail such as routing. Instead, a Screen can be directly returned
from a Widget, or from a page builder - it's up to you.

For this example, we'll be using the `SignInScreen` widget, which is a fully styled sign-in screen. We can ensure application users
are signed-in to our application by using the the `authStateChanges` stream from the `FirebaseAuth` service. If the user is not signed-in,
we will directly render the `SignInScreen` widget:

```dart
class MyApplication extends StatlessWidget {
  const MyApplication({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<User?>(
      stream: FirebaseAuth.instance.userChanges(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        // User is not signed in!
        if (!snapshot.hasData) {
          return SignInScreen(
            providerConfigs: [
              // ... TODO!
            ],
          );
        }

        // ...
      },
    );
  }
}
```

The `SignInScreen` widget requires at a minimum a list of `ProviderConfiguration` instances are provided,
which detail the expected authentication providers a user can use to sign in with (for example, Email, Google, Facebook, etc).

By adding a new provider to the list, the UI library will render the appropriate UI in the order specified:

```dart
return SignInScreen(
  providerConfigs: [
    EmailProviderConfiguration(),
    GoogleProviderConfiguration(clientId: '...'),
  ],
);
```

> To learn more about providers, read the [providers](providers.mdx) documentation.

Such providers will render the UI with a sign-in form for email & password sign in, along with a sign-in button for Google:

Although usable, you may be looking for some more flare to your UI. The `SignInScreen` widget allows you to customize the screen
to easily provide your own UI elements, such as a logo. The widget provides a `headerBuilder` property allowing you to provide
such functionality.

For example, to add a logo which appears at the top of the screen:

```dart
return SignInScreen(
  providerConfigs: [
    // ...
  ],
  headerBuilder: (context, constraints, _) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
      child: AspectRatio(
        aspectRatio: 1,
        child: SvgPicture.asset('assets/images/logo.svg'),
      ),
    );
  },
);
```

Futhermore, for Desktop / wider screens the widget enables you to provide a side-builder, which renders
to the side of the main authentication functionality further enhancing the UI:

```dart
return SignInScreen(
  providerConfigs: [
    // ...
  ],
  headerBuilder: (context, constraints, _) {
    // ...
  },
  sideBuilder: (context, constraints) {
    return Center(
      child: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(constraints.maxWidth / 8),
        child: SvgPicture.asset(
          'assets/images/sign_in_background.svg',
          width: constraints.maxWidth / 2,
          height: constraints.maxWidth / 2,
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
);
```

## Views & Widgets

Typically a Screen is a high-level abtraction which contains multiple Views.
