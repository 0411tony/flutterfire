title: Web Installation
---

When using FlutterFire on the web, the Firebase JavaScript SDKs are automatically installed.

:::info

If you have previously manually included the Firebase scripts in your `web/index.html` file, you can
safely remove them by following the [automated web installation](automated-web-installation.mdx) guide.

:::

When [initializing FlutterFire](../overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire), ensure you provide the
`FirebaseOptions` for a web application which can be found on the
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/):

```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: const FirebaseOptions(
    apiKey: '...',
    authDomain: '...',
    databaseURL: '...',
    projectId: '...',
    storageBucket: '...',
    messagingSenderId: '...',
    appId: '...',
    measurementId: '...',
  ),
);
```

This initialization flow is cross-platform compatible.

## Initializing FlutterFire

Once complete follow the instructions on [Initializing FlutterFire](../overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire).
